## Story of the game creation

For Christmas 2015, my team decided to go for a new kind of "gift matcher" for our [400'000 customers throughout Europe](https://web.archive.org/web/20151223075234/http://www.expansys.com/).
After years and 29 countries under the belt, we knew our customer segments and what will sell.
After all this is global e-commerce marketing knowledge. 
But we wanted more.

Segments information is coming from limited analytics studies.
All of these studies are aiming at the same goals.
Do we really know our customers?
Why not asking them who they are?

I proposed to ask each customer only 4 questions and based on that to offer them what we thought her/his profile was and a selection of our products that match this personality.
We did the same when you reply for a friend's pesonality.

It was a hit!
People loved that.

We were not seeing just global segments bying our stuff after crawling our site, we were tailoring the website to each customer's personality.
We collected valuable knowledge and understading about our customers.
But does personality really matters?

### Second experiment
Then, in 2016, while being the head of the Europe marketing department of this e-commerce global service, I got interested to VR development and immediately developed a free Android VR app advertised to each personality.

All personalities had the same app, but were driven to it based on their interest in VR and their personality.

I collected the only VR centric market analysis based on user personalities.
At the CES 2017, I presented results to a [selected audience](https://www.eventbrite.com/myevent?eid=30558728981).

### And now ... a cards game?
"Science without conscience is but the ruin of the Soul" (Rabelais). 

We needed to help people understand personalities, theirs and others.

I started another app, and soon realized people really open themselves when playing casual games with friends. Not a lonely experience but a collective, fast paced, projection in a situation.

That's how started this humble game.

Since personalities are not really well known globally, I decided to focus on traits driven by these pesonalities. 

We collected approximately 240 traits for 16 personalities.

You are more than welcome to share about your traits in your personality and rate the closeness to your personality or a friend's one.
That's why each card has a unique number in the right lower corner. Simply rate and comment the card indicating its number.

### The end?
This cards game and training is part of a bigger project to come.
